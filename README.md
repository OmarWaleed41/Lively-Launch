# Lively-Launch
With Windows 11 rainmeter has become, well... not too great and i'm looking for the best customization possible on any of my devices so i came up with a solution to let me control my apps/files through my desktop

With animated buttons/widgets and a GUI to control the app
I used Lively Wallpaper to run the entire app on desktop

Use the `install.bat` file to install the node modules and add the server to the startup folder so it starts with windows
and finally add `index.html` to lively 

If you wish to create your own Widget either let me know or you an take a look at the widgets like `weather.js` and you'll see the critical stuff and add your own
